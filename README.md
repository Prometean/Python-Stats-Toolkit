Python-Stats-Toolkit: Basic Statistical Tools in Python

This repository contains a Python project titled 'Python-Stats-Toolkit', which demonstrates basic statistical calculations using Python. It is aimed at showcasing foundational Python skills relevant in data science and analytics fields.

The main script in this repository, 'stats_toolkit.py', provides an interactive way for users to input a list of numbers and receive statistical insights - specifically the average (mean) and median of the list. The tool is designed to handle various edge cases, such as invalid inputs and empty lists, ensuring robustness and user-friendliness.

Key Features:

* User Input Handling: Accepts a list of numbers from the user, ensuring that only valid numeric inputs are processed.
* Average Calculation: Computes the average of the provided list of numbers, demonstrating aggregation techniques.
* Median Calculation: Calculates the median, catering to both odd and even-length lists, showcasing sorting and conditional logic.
* Error Handling: Gracefully manages non-numeric inputs and empty lists, enhancing the user experience and reliability of the tool.

Usage:
This tool is particularly useful for beginners in Python and data science, providing a hands-on experience in basic data processing and statistics. It can also serve as a reference for basic Python operations like list handling, sorting, and exception management.

Future Scope:
Plans for expanding this project include adding more statistical functions, such as mode, variance, and standard deviation calculations, as well as visualizations of the data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
